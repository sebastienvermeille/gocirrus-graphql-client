## Getting started

Simply run `go get github.com/sebastienvermeille/gocirrus-graphql-client@v0.0.1`

### Example - Authenticate to Cirrus
TODO: document

### Example - Run a query
TODO: document


# Sidenote

This is my first project using golang, 
if you see some good practice not applied here, I would be happy to hear from you.
